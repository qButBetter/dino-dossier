<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="left-shift">
    The Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, or more commonly known as the Spinosaurus, is a dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period. 
    It lived around 99 million to 93.5 million years ago. 
    The Spinosaurus belongs to the Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus species, and the Class of Reptilia. 
    Other relatives of the Spinosaurus, such as the Irritator and the Baryonyx, belong to the Spinosauridae family as well. 
    Most Spinosaurus skeletons were found around North Africa and Egypt.
    Today, it's generally a desert, but back 93 million years ago, it was a vast river system and flourishing with flora. 
    Many other Spinosaurus specimens were found around Asia, Europe, and South America.
    They likely lived in the same environment as North Africa 93 million years ago.
    Relatives of the Spinosaurus, like the Irritator of Brazil, lived farther away from the Spinosaurus for unknown reasons.
    The first person to discover Spinosaurus remains was Ernst Stromer in 1915 in Egypt.
    The main part of the identification of the Spinosaurus and its relatives is, of course, its spine/sail. 
    In most media, the Spinosaurus' sail is very dull, but many researchers believe that its sail was more colorful, most likely used for social interactions. 
    The sail would have been used like a male peacocks' colorful feathers. 
    Most Spinosaurus specimens recovered were from 14m to 18m in length.
    So, most Spinosaurus would be as long as a standard volleyball court.
