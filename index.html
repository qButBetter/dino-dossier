<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="left-shift">
    The Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, or more commonly known as the Spinosaurus, is a dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period. 
    It lived around 99 million to 93.5 million years ago. 
    The Spinosaurus belongs to the Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus species, and the Class of Reptilia. 
    Other relatives of the Spinosaurus, such as the Irritator and the Baryonyx, belong to the Spinosauridae family as well. 
    Most Spinosaurus skeletons were found around North Africa and Egypt.
    Today, it's generally a desert, but back 93 million years ago, it was a vast river system and flourishing with flora. 
    Many other Spinosaurus specimens were found around Asia, Europe, and South America.
    They likely lived in the same environment as North Africa 93 million years ago.
    Relatives of the Spinosaurus, like the Irritator of Brazil, lived farther away from the Spinosaurus for unknown reasons.
    The first person to discover Spinosaurus remains was Ernst Stromer in 1915 in Egypt.
    The main part of the identification of the Spinosaurus and its relatives is, of course, its spine/sail. 
    In most media, the Spinosaurus' sail is very dull, but many researchers believe that its sail was more colorful, most likely used for social interactions. 
    The sail would have been used like a male peacocks' colorful feathers. 
    Most Spinosaurus specimens recovered were from 14m to 18m in length.
    So, most Spinosaurus would be as long as a standard volleyball court.

<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p class="left-shift"> 
    The Spinosaurus lived mostly in North African swamps and muddy areas with water. 
    The Spinosaurus also lived in Asia, Europe, and South America. 
    They mostly lived there because, 95 million years ago, it was a prosperous ecosystem rather than its present day deserts and tropics. 
    Its habitat provided plenty of fish and other prey to the Spinosaurus. 
    Its relatives lived in similar places, such as Brazil and England.
    Most of the fossils were found in these places, so scientists can only infer that they lived in these places.
    The Spinosaurus also lived in mangrove swamps, which also generally yielded plentiful prey.

<h2>Behaviors/Adaptations/Breeding</h2>
<p class="left-shift">
    The Spinosaurus was a mostly water-bound creature, but it still went on land from time to time. 
    It had very dense bones to have greater buoyancy in the water. 
    Its long, narrow jaw was used to capture fish much easier, similar to a fishnet. 
    Along with that, its teeth were straight, unlike other carnivores during that time period. 
    The Spinosaurus hunted Coelacanths, Onchopristis (sawfish), and Mawsonia with its long, narrow jaw. 
    Scientists do not know exactly how the Spinosaurus bred, but it was concluded that the eggs would be laid on land, covered in dried brush, leaves, and other vegetation to conceal them.
